# 💼 Portfolio Website -Full Stack Challenge

This project is part of my 20-day self-driven challenge to become a full stack web developer.  
Guided by AI tools, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔥 What I’ve Learned So Far:
- HTML structure and tags
- CSS styling and layout
- Git and GitHub usage
- Hosting static websites with GitHub Pages

## 🧠 Why This Project:
This is my personal portfolio — created step-by-step to track my progress and build a real web presence.

## 📁 Files in This Repo:
- `index.html` → main page
- `style.css` → styling
- `script.js` → interactivity
- `images/` → profile picture and assets

## 🌐 Live Demo:
> Will be added once GitHub Pages is connected
